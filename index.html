			<h2 class="info__title">About Us</h2>
			<p class="info__copy">
				Hello all!! Our names are Cricket Wuebker and Faith Hagelberger, and we are the founders of the Connected by Color
				organization. <br><br>We recently created Connected by Color to raise money to support us on our mission trip to Haiti this June. We will be selling sets of identical handcrafted friendship bracelets. When the bracelets are purchased, one
				will go to the donor, and the other will be given to a child in Haiti. Through this project, we hope to connect our
				community to Haitians through the colors on their wrist, coining to Connected by Color. The threads will connect those
				who are destined to meet, regardless of time, place or circumstances.<br><br>Donations that exceed our traveling expenses, we will be donating to a foundation that builds wells near orphanages to provide them with fresh water. An annual scholarship to fund mission trips for other students is also being established. <br><br>As a college student and an incoming college student, we understand that mission trips can be financially challenging. We wish to create this scholarship to help a yearly student fund their trip as well. <br><br>Our local area has worked incredibly hard to build the close-knit, supportive, and compassionate community that we all are blessed with today. We are asking that you continue this tradition by supporting our foundation, so that those in
				need will feel the love and kindness that our community is known for. <br><br>Thank you for your time, consideration, and compassion. We have already received tremendous support from area organizations and businesses, and our hearts are full.
